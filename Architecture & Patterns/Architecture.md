# 🧱 Clean Architecture, Repository Pattern, and Service Layer in Django

These three concepts belong to **software architecture design** — they define how you organize your code and separate different layers of responsibility inside your project.  
Below is a simple, Django/DRF-oriented explanation 👇

---

## 🧩 1. Clean Architecture

**Idea:**  
Design your project so that the **core business logic** is independent of frameworks, databases, and external tools.

If you ever switch from Django to FastAPI or from PostgreSQL to MongoDB, your core logic should remain intact.

A Clean Architecture is typically organized in layers:

```
Presentation (Views / APIs)
↓
Application (Service Layer)
↓
Domain (Business Logic)
↓
Infrastructure (ORM, Database, External APIs)
```

In Django, this structure can be implemented using modular apps or separate folders for each layer.

## 🧱 2. Repository Pattern

The **Repository Pattern** separates **data access** from **business logic**.

Instead of using `Model.objects.filter(...)` directly inside your views or services, you create a repository class responsible for database operations:

```python
class UserRepository:
    def get_by_id(self, user_id):
        return User.objects.get(id=user_id)

    def get_active_users(self):
        return User.objects.filter(is_active=True)
```

Then, other parts of your code interact only with `UserRepository` — not directly with Django ORM.

✅ **Benefits:**
- Easier testing (you can mock repositories)
- Changing ORM or database only affects the repository layer

---

## ⚙️ 3. Service Layer

The **Service Layer** contains your **business logic**, separate from views and models.

Example:

```python
class UserService:
    def activate_user(self, user_id):
        user = UserRepository().get_by_id(user_id)
        user.is_active = True
        user.save()
        send_activation_email(user.email)
```

This keeps your views/controllers lightweight and makes the code easier to test and maintain.

## 🔍 Summary

| Concept | Role | Key Benefit |
|----------|------|--------------|
| **Clean Architecture** | Overall structure independent from frameworks | Separation of logic and dependencies |
| **Repository Pattern** | Data access layer | Decouples ORM from business logic |
| **Service Layer** | Business logic layer | Cleaner views, better testability |

---

💡 **Tip:**  
For small to medium Django projects, you can gradually introduce these patterns (especially the Service Layer) as your codebase grows — no need to over-engineer from day one.
